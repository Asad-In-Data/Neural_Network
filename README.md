# Neural_Network


Welcome to the world of Neural Networks where zeros and ones come alive!  
If you ever wondered how computers start “**thinking**”, you’re at the right place.  
Yahan sirf code nahi, asli AI ka jadoo hai! 😎

## Why this repo?

- Pure Python implementation no black magic, just logic!
- Step-by-step tutorials, sample projects, and commented code
- Understand neural networks “from the neuron up”
- Perfect for students, hobbyists, and those who just want to say: “I built a neural network, bro!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo and enter the matrix:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asad-In-Data/Neural_Network.git
   cd Neural_Network
   ```
2. **Install dependencies (requirements.txt dekh lein, warna python bhi gussa kar sakta hai!):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run and enjoy:**
